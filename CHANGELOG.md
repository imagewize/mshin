## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-05

First tagged release. Avendesora is a self-hosted, Wheel of Time-themed
cybersecurity AI system that pairs a local LLM (Ollama) with Kali Linux
tools over the Model Context Protocol (MCP), split across two LAN-connected
hosts (Core for inference, Node for tool execution).

> **Status:** the components build, `node --check` passes, and the MCP
> server responds to `GET /health`. End-to-end tool execution still needs
> validation on real Kali / Core hardware.

### Added

- **Custom Kali MCP server** (`servers/src/kali/`) built on the official MCP
  SDK with an SSE transport on port `3000`, exposing `nmap`, `metasploit`,
  `searchsploit`, `nikto`, `whois`, and `tshark`. Each client connection gets
  its own server instance and session-keyed transport, with cleanup on
  disconnect. Arguments run through `execFile` (no shell) with validation
  against shell metacharacters and null bytes.
- **Avendesora CLI client** (`clients/avendesora-cli/`) driving Ollama native
  tool-calling against the Node over MCP, with a `GET /health` reachability
  check and a `--node` / `--ollama` / `--model` interface.
- **Provisioning scripts** for both hosts: `scripts/setup_mcp_server.sh` (Node)
  and `scripts/setup_ollama.sh` (Core) — installing Node.js 20+, cloning the
  repo under `/opt/avendesora`, wiring the systemd service and CLI wrapper, and
  configuring a scoped `sudoers` allowlist.
- **Configs**: `configs/mcp-kali.service` (hardened systemd unit) and
  `configs/ollama-modelfile` (Avendesora persona and tool list).
- **Documentation**: `README.md`, `KALI-OPENLLM.md` master guide, and the
  `docs/` split guides (architecture, setup, workflows, agent roadmap).

### Fixed

- Install the `exploitdb` apt package (which ships the `searchsploit` binary)
  instead of the nonexistent `searchsploit` package, which aborted provisioning
  under `set -e`.
- Make the CLI entrypoint executable so the Core wrapper's direct `exec`
  launches it.
- Correct the netplan config heredoc in `setup_ollama.sh` (dropped a stray
  `cat |` that left a dangling process reading stdin) and use the
  non-deprecated `routes:` syntax in both provisioning scripts.
- Align the ASCII architecture diagrams across `README.md`, `KALI-OPENLLM.md`,
  `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/cybersecurity-agent-roadmap.md` so borders
  line up in a monospace font.
